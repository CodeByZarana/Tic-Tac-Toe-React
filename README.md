Dynamic UI: Responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes.
Real-time Gameplay: Players can take turns placing their marks on the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
Winning Logic: The game detects and highlights the winning combination once a player wins.
Reset Functionality: Players can easily reset the game to start a new round.

## Technologies Used
